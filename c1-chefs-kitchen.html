Let me preface this post by saying that I can't remember the last time I was this excited about something. Being accepted into and now being a part of DBC is the most incredible feeling. For years I've wanted to acquire the skills necessary to be a developer but with no real hope of that dream materializing - now I can see the dream can come true.

You look at many MANY options when you're about to quit the life you know and start something new. That was me looking for the right dev camp to help me start this new journey in my life. After weeks of research and interviews there was one camp on the top of my list, Dev Bootcamp. More than reputation or suggestion, I was captivated by the passion and vision of DBC. The idea of going on this adventure to obtain not only a new skill but with a new perspective on my life hit home for me. I wanted to be in an environment of engaged peers, people working relentlessly and enjoyably to achieve a new version of themselves. I wanted to work with teams of people, sharing ideas and pushing each other across the finish line. That is why I choose DBC. Because of its soul.

I can't wait to meet and work with my fellow pocketgophers! As Leeroy once said...<br>
