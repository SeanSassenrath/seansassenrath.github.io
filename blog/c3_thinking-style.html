        <h2 class="blogPost">OPPA THINKING STYLE</h2>
        <p>
        According to the Gregorc Thinking Style, I'm a Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random thinker. This means that I like to learn in an orderly, logical sequence either by listening to others or focusing deeply at the present issues. I learn best when I have a structured system where I can practice realistic examples with others. It's difficult for me to follow incomplete or unclear directions especially in a hostile environment.

        <h2 class="blogPost">STRUGGLESVILLE</h2>
        <p>
        The biggest struggle so far in Phase 0 has been time management. I knew it would be tough working full time and going through Phase 0, but it's been even more difficult than I thought. The amount of projects at my current job have been increasing, life events keep coming up, and I find myself up at 3am working on my code, which despite the yearning for sleep, is one of my favorite parts of the day. Of course sometimes sleep wins and my time to learn loses, I've even fallen asleep on my desk a few times this past week. I think the best solution would be wake up early and allocate at least 1.5 hrs to Phase 0 before my day even starts, that way if I get too tired after work at least I've spent some time in the morning honing my skills and completing exercises.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">GOING FOR GROWTH</h2>
        <p>
        I truly believe that adopting a growth mindset after having a fixed mindset for so long has been one of the key differences in my ability to learn so far. Having shed the idea that I wasn't intelligent enough to pick up how to become a web developer, reading books has become fun (for the most part I'm terrible at learning from books)! Things that I thought I'd never understand are now becoming common knowledge. It's the most inspiring and motivating part of this experience so far, the feeling of progress. I'm hoping that it stays with me as things get more difficult.
