        <h1>HOW TO ASK GOOD QUESTIONS</h1>
        <h3>04.3.2015</h3>
        <h2 class="blogPost">5 TIPS TO BETTER QUESTIONS</h2>
        <p>
        Sometimes the largest obstacle when trying to devise a solution can be asking the right question. It’s not enough to just have a question. You need to sell the question to catch the best possible answer. Through my career, my time at DBC and research online, I’ve put together a list of how to ask great questions.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
          <h3>1. Research and Implementation</h3>
          <p>
          It’s tempting to give up and ask a question when something get’s difficult. I’ve found however that this robs the me from learning at a deeper level. I don’t learn half as well without going through the struggle of research and implementation. Most of the time I learn the material needed to arrive at the solution, but even if I don’t, I’ll have a much deeper understanding of question which will help in my formulation of it.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <h3>2.  Keep It Simple</h3>
          <p>
          The key to this point is to keep the readers in mind. Don’t regurgitate every little detail
          you discovered through your research. Give them a simple, clear, and logical line of    “Here’s my question” - “Here’s how I’m trying to solve the problem” - “Where am I going wrong?” This ‘question asking’ structure allows the reader to easily analyze the problem and see that you’ve at least tried solving it yourself. Questions that contain irrelevant detail are easy to spot and will have a harder time attracting a response.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <h3>3.  Tag Appropriately</h3>
          <p>
          Depending on the volume of the site, questions can get lost the instant it’s posted. One
          way to avoid this is to use appropriate tags. What are the core elements of your question? You can create tags of these core elements to make your question easier to find. Some examples of good tags would be the language used, operator names, methods, etc.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <h3>4.  Respond to Feedback</h3>
          <p>
          Community is everything. Nurture that community by looking at all feedback from your question and respond to it. If you don’t understand the answer, begin a dialogue to dig further into the subject. It’s often said that the developer community is one of the best and most supportive, so don’t be afraid to follow up an answer to your question with another question.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <h3>5.  Make a Great Title</h3>
          <p>
            I made this the last point because in some cases it’s easier to come up with an informative title after you formulate your question. Coming up with a great title can make a huge difference in the interaction with your question. A well made question title will help attract great answers.
          </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        There you have it! Make sure to research your problem first, if you can’t find the solution, keep your question simple, tag appropriately, respond to the feedback you get, and make an enticing title.
