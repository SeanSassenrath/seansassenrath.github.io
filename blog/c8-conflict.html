        <h1>CONFLICT</h1>
        <h3>3.27.2015</h3>
        <h2 class="blogPost">MY MOST RECENT CONFLICT</h2>
        <p>
          I currently work in marketing for wine company, and one of our wine brands is turning 200 years old this year. To celebrate this occasion, I wanted to organize a “birthday party” for the brand in NYC. My boss had approved the idea and I began to work with our PR agency to build the proposal for final approval. We spent hours finding venues, discussing layout options, wines to be poured, everything you could think of. After the proposal was finished, my boss submitted the proposal up the chain where it was not only rejected but insulted. Upper management made it sound like we had everything wrong. The venue was too much money, the wines weren’t right, the format of the tasting was incorrect, etc. Needless to say I was very upset. We had poured so much time and thought into this idea, only to have it squashed. The most frustrating part and where the true conflict lied, was that the idea wasn’t “wrong”, it was just different. Over and over again we do the same style of event’s / marketing promotions and over and over again they do nothing.  Look it up and you’ll see that it’s the definition of insanity. I wasn’t angry because our idea failed, I was angry because the leaders of the company were yet again not open minded enough to try something new.

          After being humiliated, I went back to my office to think about what had just happened. How could I have done things differently? How could I have made this proposal so that it had a new edge, but was acceptable. I eventually realized that it was just the way things were at the company. No matter how badly I wanted to help bring something new to the table, the culture was stuck in the past. I wasn’t there to consult on how to lead the ship, I was only there to help row it. Once I accepted that reasoning, the anger began to fade. Instead of feeling angry I began to feel restless, it was time to move on to something new, someplace new.

          My realization wasn’t by any means a solution to the problem, but it was a solution to the emotional state I was in. My take away from this experience is that you can’t take these conflicts personally. You have to look at it from multiple angles and decide if you can keep going and make changes in the future, or if it’s time to move on to something else.
