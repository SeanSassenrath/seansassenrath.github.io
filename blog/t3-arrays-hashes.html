        <h1>When to Array and When to Hash</h1>
        <h3>2.19.15</h3>
        <p>
          So there you are, working on your program, when all of sudden you realize that you need a structure to store data! What do you turn to? Look no further than to your friendly Array or Hash. This blog post will cover what these data storing object indexers are, how they work and how to recognize which structure to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arrays and Hashes are index’s of collected objects. In other words, they store objects inside themselves in an organized fashion so that these objects can be called on by the program. Think of these structures as linked set of treasure chests each with an object inside it. When the program wants something inside one of the chests, it presents a key to open the chest and access the object.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">ARRAYS</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays are unique in that they only use an ordered set of integers as keys. In Arrays, the integer count starts at 0 instead of 1. This can take some getting used to.  For example, say we wanted to access the number "2" in the following array: Numbers = [1, 2, 3], we would do so by calling the array followed by the index: Numbers[1], which would unlock the chest at first index and give us the number "2".
        </p>

        <p>Arrays can be created in a couple different ways.  One way is to use brackets, like so:</p>

        <p><span class="blogPost">first_three_months = [“Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar”]</span></p>

        <p>Shortcut Alert! By using the %w notation, we can write out our strings without commas or quotes :)</p>

        <p><span class="blogPost">first_three_months = %w[Jan Feb Mar]</span></p>

        <p>We just created an array called first_three_months! Awesome!</p>

        <p>Now the second way to create an array is by using the .new method.  For example:</p>

        <p><span class="blogPost">first_three_months = Array.new</span></p>

       <p> From there we can index objects into the array:</p>

       <p><span class="blogPost">first_three_months[0] = “Jan”</span><br/>
         <span class="blogPost">first_three_months[1] = “Feb”</span><br/>
         <span class="blogPost">first_three_months[2] = “Mar”</span><br/>
       </p>

        <p>Excellent! You’re on your way to becoming an Array champion! Now let’s see what’s going on in the world of Hashes.</p>

        <h2 class="blogPost">HASHES</h2>

        <p>Like Arrays, Hashes are structures that index objects, however instead of using an ordered enumerable system, Hashes use key value pairs. Nothing to it! Instead of one object in brackets like we did in Arrays, we’ll have two objects (the key and the value) in braces for Hashes.  Let’s create a hash to store a username, password and email.</p>

        <p><span class="blogPost">user_info = {<br/>
             <span class="blogPost">username: sean,</span><br/>
             <span class="blogPost">password: 1234,</span><br/>
             <span class="blogPost">email: sean@sean.com</span><br/>
             <span class="blogPost">}</span>
        </p>

        <p>Boom! There it is. And just like Arrays, you can use the .new method to create a Hash as well:</p>

        <p><span class="blogPost">user_info = Hash.new</span></p>

        <p>Hashes are also indexed using the block notation.</p>

        <p><span class="blogPost">user_info[username:] = sean</span></p>

        <p>Unlike Arrays however, Hashes store a default value of “nil” when a key is called that doesn’t have a value.</p>

        <p><span class="blogPost">user_info[age:] = nil</span></p>

        <h2 class="blogPost">WHEN TO USE WHAT</h2>

        <p>Now that we have a basic understanding of what Arrays and Hashes do, let’s quickly talk about when to use them.</p>

        <p>Array’s are rigid, but efficient. In most cases you’d want to use an array when the objects follow a numeric sequence that aligns with the index numbering, such as the first_three_months example.</p>

        <p>Hashes are more flexible. They are best used when a numeric index doesn’t match well with the objects being stored, such as the user_info example. It’s much easier to call the value “sean” by referencing the username: key than by referencing index 0.</p>

        <p>And there you have it! Arrays and Hashes are yours for the taking. Use them wisely!</p>
