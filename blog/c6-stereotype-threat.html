        <h1>IMPOSTOR SYNDROME</h1>
        <h3>3.14.2015</h3>
        <h2 class="blogPost">WHAT IS IT?</h2>
        <p>
        As I become more involved in the software development community, I see the frequently mentioned topic of Impostor Syndrome. Impostor Syndrome is defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist even in the face of information that indicates the opposite is true. It creates a perspective of self-doubt and makes one feel intellectually fraudulent. I think for a lot of people getting into this field, Impostor Syndrome is one of the first big barriers to entry.

        <h2 class="blogPost">MY OWN FEAR</h2>
        <p>
        I hate to diagnose myself, but I’m sure that I already have Impostor Syndrome just by being in the DBC program. Now that I’m actually taking the time to think and reflect on it, I think it stems from when I was a kid. In elementary school there was a special program called GATE for kids who were deemed the most intelligent in their class. Some of my closest friends and even my own brother were apart of this special program, I however was not. For whatever reason it really set my own expectations of myself. Instead of thinking “how can I learn what I need to learn to get into GATE”, I would think “Too bad, you’re just not a smart enough person, you’ll never achieve what they’ll be able to achieve.”. It’s strange to think about that now, but I think it gave me a capped potential / fixed mindset for the longest time.

        Attending DBC has been my big first attempt at breaking up this idea that I’m in a sub-category of intelligence. I know I have the potential to be more, to do better, but sometimes it’s still hard to shake the feeling that I’m not cut out to be a software engineer. The is when this feeling snowballs out of control. For instance on some of the recent GPS assignments, I was left without a pair. Having all of the attention on me and my performance during the session made me feel incredibly insecure no matter how hard I fought it. I’d stumble through the exercise only to discover after the session just how easy the assignment was. I knew how to do everything! Why is that I couldn’t do it when the guide was there? I believe it was because I spent more mental energy feeling like an imposter than I did trying to solve the problem. Once that anxiety left, my mind was free to solve the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
        I don’t expect myself to overcome these feelings overnight, but I do believe over time and in the right atmosphere, I can extinguish it. I am going to DBC because I believe it is the right atmosphere. Now, it’s just a matter of time.
