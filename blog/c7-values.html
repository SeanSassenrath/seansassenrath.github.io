        <h1>PERSONAL VALUES</h1>
        <h3>03.20.2015</h3>
        <h2 class="blogPost">MY VALUES</h2>
        <p>
        Values:
        Accomplishment - Adventure - Achievement - Close Relationships - Confidence - Creativity - Decisiveness - Efficiency - Enthusiasm - Faith - Freedom - Friendships - Growth - Having a Family - Health - Helping Others - Honesty - Integrity - Loyalty - Meaningful Work - Mentorship - Peace - Physical Challenge - Recognition - Romance - Self-reliance - Sophistication - Spirituality - Wisdom
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">DO I LIVE BY THESE VALUES?</h2>
        <p>
        In general, I try to live up to these values: 5 Agree
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>
        All of the values listed above are important to me. Out of all them though, the most important is that of having a family. I’m so blessed to have a family that loves and supports me. Nothing in this world is worth doing without others. Without my family and friends, I’d have no one to celebrate my accomplishments with and no one to help me when I fail. I can do a lot on my own, but it’s all for not without them.

        Funny enough, the last topic someone asked me advice on was going to a bootcamp for web development! I was attending a meetup at Girl Develop It with my girlfriend, and someone at the meetup was looking at possibly joining a bootcamp. I could only offer her my thoughts on the process I went through to get into DBC and how Phase 0 was going so far, but it was great to share information with someone who was seeking any bit of knowledge I might have. It’s incredibly important to help others. We can accomplish so much more by helping one another than we ever will trying to do everything ourselves. Nothing brings me more joy.
        </p>
        <p>
        I feel a more whole sense of self when I think about these values. It makes me feel more comfortable about who I am and what I can do. I’m going to try my best to meditate on these values when I feel imposter syndrome, hopefully it’ll help me fight through it!
