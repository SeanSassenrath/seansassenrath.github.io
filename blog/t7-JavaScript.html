        <h1>DOCUMENTED DIFFERENCES</h1>
        <h3>3.20.2015</h3>
        <h2 class="blogPost">RUBY vs JS</h2>
        <p>
        One the most helpful tools when writing code is finding correct and thorough documentation about the language you’re using. Just as important, is that the piece of documentation itself that you are trying to find is found easily. The number of times I’ve had to look up questions or methods in Phase 0 has been more than I ever imagined. Without proper documentation, it would have taken me weeks what I can now do in days. However, not all languages have the same setup in terms of their documentation . As I came to find out this week, Ruby and Javascript are quite different in this regard.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">RUBY DOCS</h2>
        <p>
        The first few weeks of Phase 0, the RubyDocs website became my best friend. A listed resource full of descriptions and examples of built in methods and more. I felt like a kid in a candy store. How do I iterate over an array and replace the value? BAM! Found it in the RubyDocs. It was an incredible centrally located oasis of much needed information.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">JAVASCRIPT DOCS</h2>
        <p>
        When I began JavaScript this week it was a little bit of a shock. Where was the pillar of information that I had with Ruby? Documentation was parsed and scattered over multiple websites, some with great examples and others with irrelevant content. I was able however to get my bearings and settled on W3School and Mozilla Documentation to be my go-to source of development content. In some ways they are similar in format to the Ruby Doc, so it all worked out.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
        There’s a lot out there in terms of documentation, more than just RubyDocs and W3School, but in terms of a beginner, I much prefer the structure and set up of the RubyDocs. Maybe that will change as I progress in JavaScript, but for now I’d have to give the win to Ruby documentation.
