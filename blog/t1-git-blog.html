<h1>Git, Github and The Terminal walk into a bar...</h1>

<p>
It's crazy to think that just a week ago I barely knew what git was, if it was synonmous with GitHub, or how to work either of them using the terminal. I'm by no means an expert now, but now I have a foundation to build on.

<h3>Git</h3>
Git is a version control system used by software developers. Version control is system that allows a developer (and co-developers) to build a project with different save points (commits) and gives them the flexability to minipulate and combine these save points into the "master" project itself. Say you were writing a book and this book had magical "git" powers. You as the author could take content out, put content in, let others add content to it, and also revert to a previous stage of the books development.  That's git.

<h3>GitHub</h3>
GitHub on the other hand is a location on the web that stores projects that have been added using the git system. As I mentioned above, git allows multiple people to work on the same project, however the only way to combine everyone's work is to send the altered project directly to the other contributors. This is where GitHub comes in. If git is the magical ability to write a book with version control, GitHub would be the library. In this library you could checkout the book being worked on, edit it, create a save point and return it. The magic of the GitHub Library however is that multiple people can check out the "master" version of the book at the same time and drop it off with their changes without waiting for anyone to return it.
