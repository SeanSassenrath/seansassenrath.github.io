        <h1>PAIRING IS CARING</h1>
        <h3>3.5.2015</h3>
        <p>
        One of the most fascinating parts of DBC, if not the most fascinating part, has been pair programming. So far I’ve had around 10 or so pair programming sessions, and so far they’ve each been unique. At the beginning, my overall attitude towards this method of problem solving was around 70% positive 30% skeptical, now I’d say it’s closer to 60% / 40%.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">COMMUNICATION</h2>
        <p>
        The key to a great pair programming session is communication. Do we both understand the problem? Do we both see the problem the same way? Do we both know the goal? So far in most of my pairing sessions the answer has been yes. We quickly break down the problem, assess the goals and objectives and then proceed. However, I did have a pairing session where we disagreed on the objectives and the result was an unsuccessful outcome. We couldn’t both agree on what it was we were supposed to do. It was frustrating, but the experience itself taught me how valuable it is to establish a clear line of communication in the beginning of the session.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">SKILL GAP</h2>
        <p>
        I’ve noticed that there is a good mix of technical knowledge amongst my cohort. There are some that finish all of the assignments by the second day and are itching to move forward. Then there are those who are sorta starting to get the ideas and concepts of the week. Lastly, there are those who are still trying to grasp the concepts from the week before. Being in all three of these roles, it’s easy to see how sometimes it can be frustrating to work at a different speed than your pair. I’ve been in situations where I’ve had to ask my pair to slow down and explain our solution, and I’ve also been the one who was going to fast for my pair to keep up. I’m still working on how to handle these situations when the skill gap doesn’t match, but so far I think everyone’s done a pretty good job helping their pair out, not only by solving the problem, but by teaching them the skills necessary to solve it.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blogPost">WRITING FEEDBACK</h2>
        <p>
        I often wonder if I’m doing this wrong. It’s easy enough to give an overview of the session and give them praise for their strengths, but it’s much harder for me to call them out on their weaknesses. A lot of the time I don’t feel like they have a weakness. I feel like they’re doing their best and that it’s easy for them to see what they need to work on. I’m not about to give someone downer feedback just to give them downer feedback, I want it to be something that I actually think they need to hear. For example, I received a piece of feedback that was SUPER helpful. The feedback went over the assignment, what my strengths were, but then went into the fact that I was communicating what I was doing while I was driving. I guess I was so into pseudocoding that I just went for it and didn’t tell my partner where I was going. Now I’m much more aware of that fact and always try to explain where I’m trying to go.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall, pairing and giving / receiving feedback has been incredibly beneficial. I can already feel myself getting less and less self-conscious about my coding insecurities (although I still have a ways to go). I’m so grateful for my cohort mates and that they’d take the time to solve problems with me. Can’t wait to meet and pair with them in person!
